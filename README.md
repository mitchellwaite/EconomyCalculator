# Fuel Economy Toolbox

Find it in operation at: http://mitchellwaite.ca/EconomyCalculator/

This tool is a combination of a fuel economy calculator and a converter between different fuel economy units. I created it because generally available apps online are plastered with ads and unnecessary text. 

All formulas are written in javascript. It's not terribly complex, so the final application is a single, self-contained html file.
